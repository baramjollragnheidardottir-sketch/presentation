             As part of the MMD program at UCL, we were tasked with designing a solution for the Word Festival in Odense, held at the end of January. My group focused on creating a way for visitors to easily build their own personal program. Although the festival lasts only three days, it features around 100 speakers, making it challenging for visitors to navigate the schedule. The brief also required us to design both a flyer and a poster presenting our proposed solution, with an emphasis on introducing a break from the digital world, a form of digital pause.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our concept proposed a printed solution to accompany the Word Festival newspaper: a numbered sheet referencing each speaker. Visitors could select the talks they wished to attend, and when collecting their festival ticket, a staff member would print a personalized booklet containing their individual schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
             I designed the flyer for the group, clearly communicating our concept while also including a link to a video that further explains the idea. At a later stage, I also designed a poster to better support and reinforce the concept. Using the material provided by the client, I designed both the flyer and the poster in Figma.
